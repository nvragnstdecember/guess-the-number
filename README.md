# 🎮 Guess The Number Game - Java Mini Project

## 📘 Abstract

This project presents an enhanced **"Guess the Number"** console game built using **Java**. Designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience, the game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a set number of attempts. Players can choose between **Easy, Medium, or Hard** modes that vary the range and attempts. Hints are provided to help players make informed guesses, and a scoring system adds a competitive edge.

The project is simple yet rich in logic and showcases fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** such as loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input handling.

## 🧩 Introduction

This mini-project was developed as part of the **Object Oriented Programming with Java Laboratory (22AIM36L)** course under the **Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**.

### 🎯 Goal

To accurately guess a random number generated by the system within a limited number of attempts, based on the selected difficulty level.

### 🕹️ Player Controls

- **Number Input**: Players enter guesses through the console.
- **Difficulty Selection**: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
- **Replay Option**: Option to replay and improve score.

### 🔁 Gameplay Loop

The game runs in a loop until the player guesses correctly or uses all available attempts, providing feedback after each guess.

### 🧠 Core Features

- Three difficulty levels with varying range and attempts.
- Hint system to guide closer guesses.
- Scoring system based on remaining attempts.
- Simple replay mechanism for repeated plays.
